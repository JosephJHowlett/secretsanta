# Secret Santa Generator

Made this to generate my family's yearly secret santa stuff, because we were drawing names from a hat and too often getting our partners'.

You need a bot gmail account with all the safeties disabled in its settings (google doesn't like remote access via STMP), and set the password as the env var `$SECRETSANTAEMAILPASS`. Then you should just need to edit `config.yml`!
